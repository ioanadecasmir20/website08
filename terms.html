        <h2 class="h2">1. Who we are</h2>
        <p><strong>Reliance Academy Ltd</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”). Address: 63/66 Hatton Garden, Fifth Floor, Suite 23 Hatton Garden, London, England, EC1N 8LE. Phone: 01908 991723 (Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00). Email: <a href="mailto:info@reliance-academy.co.uk">info@reliance-academy.co.uk</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">2. Booking & payment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Bookings are made online via our website using secure <strong>Stripe</strong> payment links. We do not store full card details.</li>
          <li>Your place is confirmed when payment is received and you receive our email confirmation with joining instructions.</li>
          <li>Prices are stated on the course page. Any promotional prices apply only during the stated period.</li>
          <li>Where applicable, employers may request an invoice; places are confirmed once cleared funds are received unless agreed otherwise in writing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">3. Learner eligibility & prerequisites</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimum age and identity/Right-to-Work checks may apply depending on the qualification and awarding body rules.</li>
          <li><strong>SIA-linked Door Supervisor (DS) & DS Top-Up:</strong> a valid First Aid qualification of at least <em>Emergency First Aid at Work (EFAW)</em> must be presented on Day 1. Photo ID is required. Adequate spoken and written English is necessary for safety and assessment.</li>
          <li>We can provide EFAW prior to your DS course—see our course list for dates.</li>
          <li>Please tell us in advance about any access requirements or reasonable adjustments so we can plan support in line with awarding-body policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">4. Attendance, punctuality & conduct</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You must attend <strong>all</strong> scheduled hours. Late arrival or absence may mean you cannot complete or be assessed.</li>
          <li>Bring the required ID, equipment and clothing (e.g., suitable attire for practical elements).</li>
          <li>We maintain a safe learning environment. Abusive, unsafe or disruptive behaviour may result in removal without refund.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">5. Transfers, rescheduling & substitutions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Learner transfer</strong> to a later date is usually possible if requested at least <strong>7 calendar days</strong> before the start date, subject to availability. A reasonable admin fee may apply.</li>
          <li><strong>Substitution</strong> of a learner by an employer is allowed up to 48 hours before the course start, provided eligibility requirements are met.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">6. Cancellation & refunds (learners)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You may cancel for a full refund if you notify us within <strong>14 days of booking</strong> and at least <strong>7 days before</strong> the course starts, provided you have not started receiving the service (e.g., e-learning, materials, registration).</li>
          <li>If the course begins within your 14-day cooling-off period and you asked us to start the service, you may be charged a proportionate amount for services already provided (including awarding-body registration fees).</li>
          <li>Cancellations <strong>within 7 days</strong> of the start date are non-refundable. We will try to reschedule where possible (admin fees may apply).</li>
          <li>This policy does not affect your statutory rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">7. Changes or cancellation by us</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We may postpone or cancel a course where there are events outside our control (e.g., trainer illness, insufficient enrolments, venue issues). You will be offered a new date or a full refund of the course fee paid.</li>
          <li>We are not liable for additional costs you incur (e.g., travel or accommodation). Please book refundable options where possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">8. Assessment, results & certification</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Assessment methods may include exams, practicals and assignments per awarding-body rules.</li>
          <li>Certificates are issued by the relevant awarding organisation; timescales may vary. We will notify you when available.</li>
          <li>Where a resit or reassessment is permitted, fees may apply.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">9. Non-dispute policy (chargebacks)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If you have a question or issue with your booking, <strong>contact us first</strong> at <a href="mailto:support@reliance-academy.co.uk">support@reliance-academy.co.uk</a> so we can resolve it quickly.</li>
          <li>Submitting a payment dispute/chargeback for a service we are delivering or have delivered may lead to suspension of your booking(s) and certification processes while the matter is reviewed.</li>
          <li>Where a chargeback is raised without merit, we may recover any bank dispute fees and reasonable administrative costs from you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">10. Health, safety & welfare</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Follow the trainer’s safety instructions at all times, especially during physical intervention and first-aid practicals.</li>
          <li>Tell us about any medical, access or learning needs in advance so we can make reasonable adjustments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">11. Data protection & marketing</h2>
        <p>We process personal data to manage bookings, deliver training and meet awarding-body requirements. See our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for full details. We will only send marketing where you opt in, and you can opt out at any time.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">12. Course materials & intellectual property</h2>
        <p>All course content, handouts and resources remain the intellectual property of Reliance Academy or the awarding organisation. Materials are provided for your personal learning and must not be copied, shared or resold without permission.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">13. Liability</h2>
        <p>Nothing limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or other liabilities that cannot be limited by law. Otherwise, our liability is limited to the course fee paid. We are not liable for indirect or consequential loss.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">14. Complaints</h2>
        <p>If you are unhappy with any aspect of our service, please email <a href="mailto:support@reliance-academy.co.uk">support@reliance-academy.co.uk</a>. We will acknowledge within 2 working days and aim to resolve within 10 working days. If the issue relates to assessment decisions, we will explain the awarding-body appeals route.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">15. Changes to these terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms periodically. The version published on our website at the time of booking applies to your order. Material changes will be highlighted on the website.</p>
